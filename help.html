<h1>Help</h1>

<p>
This simple interface allows you to identify one or more  combinations
of the 5 variables from a spillover paper.

The UI provides the terms that we found for a given paper
for each of the 5 variables of interest.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of possible items for each variable.
But not all of them are as likely to be relevant.
We have ordered them based on what we (the model) think is most likely.
We show them all.  However, you can hide some of the items
by changing the value of the  slider above  the list of items for that variable.
By moving the slider up, you hide items. The slider's value indicates that
all of the items to be show have to have a score at least as high as the slider's value.    
So if we move the slider to the left, we include more items as we are lowering the
score needed to appear in the list.
So as the model gets better, we can keep the scores high to only look at a few items.
This is the threshold for the classifier to include an item or not.
We need to learn this to avoid type I and II errors.

<p>
 There is one general slider that you can use to control
all of the list of items/values simultaneously.
This is slightly above and to the left of the collection of 5 individual sliders.
As you move this, it changes all of the values in the individual sliders
to the same value - <i>except those sliders that you have already changed</i>.

    
<h2>Context</h2>
You'll need to look at the paper to determine which terms and combinations are pertinent.
To help you, we show the title and the year for the paper and can toggle displaying the abstract.
And we also provide a link to the PDF for the entire document.
(If you want this in a separate window rather than a separate tab, let us know.)

<h3>Abstract</h2>
<p>
You can read the abstract directly in the page by clicking on the link named "Abstract".
And then you can hide it again by clicking on the link again. So you can toggle it at will.    

<h3>The PDF for the Paper</h3>    
 <p>
If you want to look at the PDF for the paper to go beyond the abstract, you can click on the link
at the very top-left of the page.
If it would be useful, we could add functionality to this interface to show the pages of the PDF within this
 Web page.   When you selected a value for one of the variables, we could show all the pages and text in which this occurs.
This may not work for well 
     

<h2>Number of Items and the Probability Ranges</h2>
You can look at the number of items and the probability/score ranges for the differen
variables by clicking on the "Probability Info" link on the right of the page above the table
of sliders.
This tells you how many items we identified and the maximum and minimum score from the classifier.
